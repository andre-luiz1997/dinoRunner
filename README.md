This is a game project for a C programming subject in college, made with Allegro 5.0.10 library. 

The game is basically an Google Dino Runner-based game, in wich the player has to guide a dino across a never-ending platform jumping
several cacti to remain alive. 

HOW TO PLAY:

1) Double click on "jogo.exe" and a new window will pop on the screen. 

2) Press DEL to clear previous score records or ENTER to start the game.

3) In the game, press SPACE to jump the cactus.

4) Have fun ;)
